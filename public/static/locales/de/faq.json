      "answer": [
        "Your Circles username is one of the main ways system that identifies you, besides your Circles public address. Because verifying identity is so important to the Circles system, usernames in Circles cannot be changed. Usernames are stored on an off-chain database on our Circles server and are kept private.",
        "Everytime we reset the server (only during test phase of course) all usernames will be lost forever."

      "answer": [
        "After creating a new wallet you will need 3 incoming trust connections to verify your account. You can request trust by sharing a link to your profile, or in person by having someone scan your profile QR code.",
        "We are hosting regular meet-ups in Berlin during our test phase, where you can come meet the team and connect with other Circles users in person.",
        "Once 3 people have trusted your profile the app will automatically deploy two smart contracts for you to use Circles: your Safe and your own Circles token. You will receive 100 Circles as an initial payout and continue to receive a regular UBI."

      "answer": [
        "Your Circles Safe is a smart contract that holds the keys to your account.",
        "You can add multiple devices, such as your computer or phone, to your Safe. Adding devices to your Safe can help with account recovery if you lose your seed phrase.",

      "question": "How are my Circles Produced?",
      "answer": [
        "Your Circles tokens are created automatically by the Circles smart contracts. Every day when you open the app, it checks the smart contracts for updates. Right now, Circles are paid out at a rate of about 14 per week, inflating 7% per year.",
        "The money is not coming from anywhere outside the contracts - for example, we do not collect and deposit Euro into the system. It’s also not being mined the way some cryptocurrencies are, where it’s paid out to the people who maintain the network. Instead, Circles is paid out to you every day as a reward for being part of the community, and becomes more valuable over time as the Circles community becomes stronger."

      "question": "How do I secure my Circles account?",
      "answer": [
        "There are two ways to secure your account - saving your seed phrase, and linking other devices.",
        "Saving your seed phrase: We recommend going to your profile page in the app and writing down your 24 word phrase, this is called your seed phrase and you should keep it somewhere safe. You can think of it like a password - we use it to generate your Circles keys.",
        "For security reasons, your seed phrase is normally kept hidden. You can reveal it by clicking on “Export your seed phrase” on your profile page.",
        "Linking devices: We also recommend adding a second device as soon as possible, for example, both your phone and your computer. Adding a device makes it easy to reconnect to your account if one device fails for any reason. You can add a device by going to your profile in the app and clicking “Add new device.”"

        "If you have lost one of your devices or reset your browser, you will still be able to recover your account with your seed phrase. You can go to the Circles app and click “Connect to existing account” then “Restore from seed phrase.”",
        "If you have a second device that is currently connected to your Circles account, you can still access your account from there. You should also remove the device that was lost or logged out. You can remove lost devices from your profile page in the app.",
        "If you do not have your seed phrase saved, and do not have access to another device where you are logged into Circles, we cannot retrieve your account. You are welcome to create a new account. Note that if your safe and Circles token were not deployed, your account was never fully created and there is nothing to restore."

        "The data recorded by blockchains is publicly accessible, and includes the trust network and your transaction history, but it is not associated publicly with your username or email address."

      "topic": "Trust Network",
      "question": "How does trust work in Circles?",
      "answer": [
        "You can send Circles to someone who trusts you. This means that sending Circles to someone is the reverse direction of trusting someone eg. “I trust you, therefore I accept your Circles” or “You trust me, therefore I can send my Circles to you.”",
        "When you trust someone, you can also send Circles to people in their trusted network, without directly trusting those people yourself. This is called transitive trust, and allows the Circles network to grow more easily.",
        "Example: The person might not trust you, but you happen to own someone else's token besides your own. You can still pay that person with this person’s token. <em>Example: A wants to send B 10 Circles, B does not trust A but B trusts C, A owns 10 C Token and can therefore send these 10 C Tokens to B</em>",
        "You can own multiple different Circles tokens. You are not necessarily only sending your own tokens to someone when you send Circles. You are sending the ones you have a high enough balance of + which has a large enough trust limit.",

      "question": "Warum sagt die App, dass ich keine Circles übertragen kann?",
      "answer": [
        "Manchmal gibt es keine ausreichenden Pfade über den die Token zwischen Dir und einer anderen Person geschickt werden könnten.  Vertrauensverbindungen im Circles-System kennen nicht nur eine Richtung („von“ „nach“), sondern auch ein Limit. Wenn dieses Limit erreicht ist, dann können keine Circles mehr über diesen Pfad übertragen werden, solange nicht auch Circles zurückgeflossen sind. In einer gesunden Circles-Ökonomie werden wir diese Limits nicht oft erreichen, aber manchmal kann es passieren.",
        "Vertrauens-Limits beschützen Dich davor, alle deine Token durch Transitive Transaktionen anderer Personen zu verlieren.",
        "Eine Vertrauensverbindung wird in Prozent (0-100%)  ausgedrückt, die Du bereit bist von einer bestimmten Person ihre Circles zu halten. Beispiel: Ich vertraue Dir zu 50 % der Menge Circles, die ich erhalten habe, seid ich bei Circles mitmache. Das sind 100 Circles, daher bin ich bereit, maximal 50 von deinen Circles zu halten.",
        "Das momentane Standard-Limit wird auf 50% deiner Tokens festgesetzt, was sehr viel ist und zu einem späteren Zeitpunkt vielleicht herabgesetzt werden wird."
